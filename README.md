#UDJ

UDJ is a social music player. It allows many people to control
a single music player democratically. Checkout the
[UDJ homepage][home] for more information. This is the official
UDJ Android App. For more details on actually interacting with
UDJ (so you can do something like creating your own client), see the [UDJ Server Repository][server].

## Requirements
The UDJ android app has a min-sdk version of 8. You'll also need to have/reference the
[ActionBarSherlock][abs] and [ViewPageIndicator][vpi] library projects. You will also need to have
the [Android Support Pacakge][asp] installed.
